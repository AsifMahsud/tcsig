              By now you have all heard the great news. The TCSIG Executive
              Board recommended 0% rate increase. And to top it off the Consumer
              Driven Health Plan (CDHP) has been enriched, transforming from a
              Bronze to Silver plan. This is an outstanding development that has
              been achieved by the collective efforts of all associated with
              TCSIG. Thank you to all for your efforts this past year. To
              understand how we have gotten to this enviable position, it is
              good to remind ourselves of why our organization was formed.
