            <h3>Happy New Year from Ryan Robison, JPA President</h3>
            <p class="lead">
              Happy New Year! I wish you all a safe, happy and healthy 2018. It
              has been an honor to serve you as President of our JPA’s Executive
              Board this past year. I have enjoyed working together with the
              Executive Board, TCSIG CEO, Matt Evans, TCSIG office staff, our
              service providers and, most importantly, you, our TCSIG members
              and your families. Together we form one of the most successful
              JPA’s in California. As exciting and productive as 2017 has been
              for our organization, 2018 holds even more promise. As we move
              forward into the New Year, it is important to remember that the
              key to our success continues to rest on our rock solid foundation
              established in our humble beginnings over 40 years ago. “All For
              One and One For ALL” rings true today more than ever.
