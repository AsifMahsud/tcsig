          <h3>Tips for a healthier home</h3>
          <span>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Rinse your toothbrush before and after each use to reduce the
                amount of bacteria on it. When you store your it, don’t let the
                head of your brush touch other items, like another toothbrush.
              </li>
              <li>
                Avoid sharing toothbrushes, straws, utensils and cups. These
                items gather bacteria when they touch our mouths. Sharing them
                allows bacteria to travel from one mouth to another, potentially
                causing tooth decay.
              </li>
              <li>
                Clean and disinfect items you touch frequently, including your
                toothbrush handle and holder, shower curtains, switches,
                faucets, doorknobs, phones and keyboards. Germs from these can
                make their way into your body when you touch your face.
              </li>
              <li>
                Clean your mouthguard, clear aligner, retainer or dentures daily
                to remove food and bacteria. This can help prevent oral health
                problems, including gum disease, infection, mouth sores and bad
                breath.
              </li>
              <li>
                Don’t clean pacifiers with your mouth, which could spread germs
                to your child. It’s better to rinse them with water instead.

              Connect with a dentist from home with Toothpic and Delta Dental —
              Virtual Consult
            </h3>
            <p>
              If you don’t have time or ability to see the dentist in person,
              virtual dentistry (or teledentistry) can help. Two options are
              available: Toothpic and Virtual Consult. This technology gives you
              access to Delta Dental dentists who can address your dental
              concerns and provide a consultation virtually and securely —
              anytime and anywhere.
              <br />
              These new tools are available as part of the current plan benefits
              to members covered by PPO and Premier plans. There’s no extra cost
              for using these tools, but visits will count toward diagnostic
              exam frequencies and coverage limitations may apply. They’re just
              a new way for Delta Dental members to use their existing benefits
              with Delta Dental dentists.

            </strong>
            Virtual Consult is a video-based virtual appointment tool for
            members who want to speak directly with a Delta Dental dentist. The
            dentist will speak to you about your needs and concerns, guide you
            through an exam of your mouth and can even prescribe medication if
            necessary. With Virtual Consult, members can:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Schedule and have real-time video appointments with Delta Dental
                dentists without leaving home.
              </li>
              <li>
                Have quick consultations on urgent issues, even if they don’t
                have a dentist they see regularly.
              </li>
              <li>
                Get an e-prescription and aftercare instructions for pain or
                infection.
