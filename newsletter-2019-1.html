            <p class="lead">
              Something incredible is taking place at Tri-County Schools
              Insurance Group. As a valued member of one of California’s oldest
              and most reliable healthcare JPAs, you are participating in the
              transformation process that will forever shape the quality,
              outcome and cost of healthcare services for our members and their
              dependents.
              <br />
              The TCSIG administrative support team has been re-engineered to
              combat the turbulent nature of the healthcare industry. We are
              pleased to introduce Marisa Garramore, Finance and Operations
              Manager, and Becca McIntosh, Administrative Clerk. Our new
              organizational structure while still maintaining the highest
              standards in customer service, is also designed to better evaluate
              financial data and identify emerging cost trends. Evaluating
              today’s financial and medical analytics allows us to form a
              predictive model of tomorrow’s medical costs.
