          <p>
            Mental and emotional wellness are important parts of your overall
            health. Being good to your mind is just as important as being good
            to your body — and that means living a healthy lifestyle, paying
            attention to how you feel, and doing simple things to take care of
            the whole you.

            <h4 class="text-secondary">Stick to a sleep schedule</h4>
            <p>
              Lack of sleep affects your mood, mental sharpness, and ability to
              handle stress. It’s also linked to mental health conditions like
              depression and anxiety. To create a healthy routine, go to bed and
              wake up at the same time every day — even on weekends.

            <h4 class="text-secondary">Move your body, lift your mood</h4>
            <p>
              Exercise can release tension, tame stress, and improve your sense
              of well-being. Plus, it can relieve some symptoms of depression
              and anxiety as effectively as certain medications — all with no
              side effects.

            <h4 class="text-secondary">Find your words</h4>
            <p>
              Speak up if you’re struggling. The people in your life are there
              for a reason, so be honest with your loved ones if you’re having a
              rough time. They can’t help unless they know you need their
              support.
